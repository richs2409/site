Main index included in robots.txt file as:

https://richs2409.github.io/site_od/sitemapindex.xml

Cannot use self updating Webflow main index as custom sitemap must point at the hosted index, so we must periodically create (I used https://pro-sitemaps.com/site/4375535/) and host getourdata.com sitemap at:

https://richs2409.github.io/site_od/sitemap_4375535.xml

Index loaded to google remains https://getourdata.com/sitemap.xml but this uses the new sitemapindex pasted into Webflow under SEO

Other sitemaps are referenced from sitemapindex as follows:

Gleap self updating help center sitemap:

https://help.getourdata.com/sitemap.xml

Swish.ink self updating blog sitemap at:

https://blog.getourdata.com/sitemap.xml

Other static files hosted as needed at:
